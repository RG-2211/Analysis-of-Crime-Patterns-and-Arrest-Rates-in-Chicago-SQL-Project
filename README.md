Project Overview : This project analyzes crime data from Chicago to investigate patterns and arrest rates across various communities. The analysis specifically focuses on understanding why certain crimes, like theft, have low arrest rates despite being prevalent in high-crime areas. The project utilizes SQL queries to extract and analyze data, and the findings are presented in a structured, data-driven format.

SQL Queries and Source Code : The source code file for this project - 'Source Code for Crime Patterns and Arrest Trends in Chicago Project.sql' contains the SQL queries used to analyze the data  it. Each query is accompanied by comments explaining the purpose and insights derived from the output.

Presentation : The documented presentation that explains the analysis can be found in the 'Analysis of Crime Patterns and Arrest Rates in Chicago.pdf' file. It provides a detailed walkthrough of the SQL outputs and the reasoning behind the conclusions drawn.

Additional Resources : A Google Sheets link is provided for reviewing the entire output data.
